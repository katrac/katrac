The outcome is a grid with a calculated number of adjacent mines.
Showcasing:
the data structures understanding such as arrays and dictionaries to represent the game board and track the game state, algorithmic thinking to generate and place mines, calculate adjacent mine counts and reveal cells, debugging and error handling, as well as user-centered programming with safeguards and troubleshooting to ensure it functions as intended and handles problems gracefully.</description></item></channel></rss>
