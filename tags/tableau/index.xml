The dataset consisted of 700 observations.
Employees were encouraged to choose one of the categories for reasons for their absence when reporting their absence from work. The categories are as follows:
Reason_1/Group_1: various illnesses, Reason_2/Group_2: pregnancy and childbirth-related, Reason_3/Group_3: poisoning, Reason_4/Group_4: the least serious, such as dental appointments and doctor check-ups.</description></item></channel></rss>
