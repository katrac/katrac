The median was chosen to implicitly balance the data into roughly two halves and minimize the ability of machine learning to focus exclusively on only one of the categories (i.e. 1 or 0 or ‘excessive absence’ and ‘moderate absence’).</p><h4 id=model-evaluation-and-feature-selection>Model Evaluation and Feature Selection:</h4><p>The <u>testing accuracy</u> achieved was <u>77.5%</u>, as checked with the ‘predict’ method from Scikit-Learn as well as calculating it manually. A summary table was created to see the results, with bias and weights as well as the calculation of the odds ratio for each.</p><div class="figure center fig-100"><a class=fancybox href=https://res.cloudinary.com/ds9vgnqna/image/upload/v1681483970/Summary_Table_Training_c6fpsa.png title="Summary Table" data-fancybox><img class=fig-img src=https://res.cloudinary.com/ds9vgnqna/image/upload/v1681483970/Summary_Table_Training_c6fpsa.png alt="Summary Table"></a>
<span class=caption>Summary Table</span></div><p>Based on the training results, I dropped the least explanatory features from the model, such as <i>&lsquo;Month of absence&rsquo;, &lsquo;Daily average workload&rsquo;, &lsquo;Distance to work&rsquo;, and &lsquo;Day of the week&rsquo;</i>. It was surprising to find that the daily average workload did not explain much excessive absence, as it was commonly thought that the larger the workload, the more stressed and hence absent a particular employee could be.</p><h4 id=results>Results:</h4><p>The biggest explanatory power for excessive absence seemed to have the official reasons. Since Reason_0 was dropped to avoid multicollinearity, I found that there is a higher chance of excessive absence occurring when the official reason for absence is stated by the employee. The model was then <u>tested</u> and its accuracy was <u>75%</u>.</p><h4 id=saving-the-model>Saving the Model:</h4><p>The model and scaler were saved using ‘pickle’. A module was created so that the model with preprocessing and scaler could be then re-used on future data.</p><h4 id=deployment>Deployment:</h4><p>The module was then deployed on a new dataset and the results of the analysis were exported into a .csv. The results of the deployment of the model on new data were then imported into Tableau to visualize some of the findings.</p><h4 id=findings>Findings:</h4><p>We can see that the age of an employee does not cause much excessive absence. However, the older the person gets, the more likely they will need to take more absences than younger people. Most of the employees in the new dataset were aged 20-40.</p><div class="figure fig-100"><a class=fancybox href=https://res.cloudinary.com/ds9vgnqna/image/upload/v1681488779/Age_vs_Probability_of_excessive_ab2sence_hopblp.png title="Age vs Probability of Excessive Absence" data-fancybox><img class=fig-img src=https://res.cloudinary.com/ds9vgnqna/image/upload/v1681488779/Age_vs_Probability_of_excessive_ab2sence_hopblp.png alt="Age vs Probability of Excessive Absence"></a>
<span class=caption>Age vs Probability of Excessive Absence</span></div><p>Looking at the 4 categories of reasons for absence, <i>Reason_2</i> (pregnancy and childbirth-related) was dropped, as there were no observations. We can see that people who were absent due to illness (<i>Reason_1</i>) were the most likely to be excessively absent, while people who were absent due to a medical appointment (<i>Reason_4</i>) were very unlikely to be excessively absent, as medical appointments usually don’t require more than a couple of hours off work. The poisoning had very few observations (<i>Reason_3</i>), which means that employees hardly ever reported poisoning as their reason for work absence.</p><div class="figure fig-100"><a class=fancybox href=https://res.cloudinary.com/ds9vgnqna/image/upload/v1681487833/Reason_Categories_vs_Probability_of_excessive_absence2_yb297d.png title="Reasons vs Probability of Excessive Absence" data-fancybox><img class=fig-img src=https://res.cloudinary.com/ds9vgnqna/image/upload/v1681487833/Reason_Categories_vs_Probability_of_excessive_absence2_yb297d.png alt="Reasons vs Probability of Excessive Absence"></a>
<span class=caption>Reasons vs Probability of Excessive Absence</span></div><p>The final graph shows how transportation expenses relate to employee absenteeism, and whether this relationship is influenced by the number of children an employee has.</p><p>From the graph, it&rsquo;s evident that higher transportation expenses tend to coincide with a higher likelihood of excessive employee absence. Additionally, we can observe that employees with more children generally have higher transportation costs.</p><div class="figure fig-100"><a class=fancybox href=https://res.cloudinary.com/ds9vgnqna/image/upload/v1681487983/Transportation_expenses_and_Children_vs_Probability_of_Excessive_Absence2_ukylvp.png title="Transportation Expenses &amp; Children vs Probability of Excessive Absence" data-fancybox><img class=fig-img src=https://res.cloudinary.com/ds9vgnqna/image/upload/v1681487983/Transportation_expenses_and_Children_vs_Probability_of_Excessive_Absence2_ukylvp.png alt="Transportation Expenses &amp; Children vs Probability of Excessive Absence"></a>
<span class=caption>Transportation Expenses &amp; Children vs Probability of Excessive Absence</span></div><p>Interestingly, employees without children appear to be less affected by transportation expenses. This may be because they have more flexibility in choosing where to live and can prioritise living closer to work. In contrast, employees with children must also consider factors like proximity to schools and childcare facilities.</p><div class="figure fig-100"><a class=fancybox href=https://res.cloudinary.com/ds9vgnqna/image/upload/v1681488122/No_Children2_rveuuq.png title="Transportation Expenses &amp; No Children vs Probability of Excessive Absence" data-fancybox><img class=fig-img src=https://res.cloudinary.com/ds9vgnqna/image/upload/v1681488122/No_Children2_rveuuq.png alt="Transportation Expenses &amp; No Children vs Probability of Excessive Absence"></a>
<span class=caption>Transportation Expenses &amp; No Children vs Probability of Excessive Absence</span></div><p>For employees with 1-2 children, transportation expenses tend to be higher than those without children, but mostly within the median cost range. However, there are some outliers with particularly high transportation expenses.</p><div class="figure fig-100"><a class=fancybox href=https://res.cloudinary.com/ds9vgnqna/image/upload/v1681488206/1-2_Childre2n_v92ixu.png title="Transportation Expenses &amp; 1-2 Children vs Probability of Excessive Absence" data-fancybox><img class=fig-img src=https://res.cloudinary.com/ds9vgnqna/image/upload/v1681488206/1-2_Childre2n_v92ixu.png alt="Transportation Expenses &amp; 1-2 Children vs Probability of Excessive Absence"></a>
<span class=caption>Transportation Expenses &amp; 1-2 Children vs Probability of Excessive Absence</span></div><h4 id=conclusion>Conclusion:</h4><p>The analysis highlights the importance of official reasons for employee absence. By identifying these reasons as the main driver of excessive absence, employers can take steps to address them, such as offering flexible work arrangements, providing support for employees with health issues, or implementing policies to prevent workplace injuries and accidents.</p><p>Additionally, the analysis suggests that transportation expenses could be a significant factor in employee absenteeism, particularly for those with children. This information could be valuable for employers who may consider offering transportation subsidies or other benefits to help alleviate this burden on their employees.</p><p>Overall, the machine learning model developed in Python provides a useful tool for understanding the factors that contribute to excessive employee absenteeism. By analysing a range of features and identifying the key drivers of absence, the model can help employers to make more informed decisions and take proactive steps to improve employee well-being and productivity.</p><h4 id=u-links-to-github-repositories-u><u>Links to GitHub repositories:</u></h4><ul><li><a href=https://github.com/katrac/Absenteeism_Analysis/blob/main/Data%20preprocessing%20%26%20Building%20ML%20model/Preprocessing.ipynb>Data Preprocessing</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/katrac/Absenteeism_Analysis/blob/main/Data%20preprocessing%20%26%20Building%20ML%20model/Training%20model_1_backward%20elimination.ipynb>Model Building &amp; Training</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/katrac/Absenteeism_Analysis/blob/main/Data%20preprocessing%20%26%20Building%20ML%20model/Testing%20the%20model.ipynb>Model Testing</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/katrac/Absenteeism_Analysis/tree/main/Absenteeism%20module>Absenteeism module for deployment</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/katrac/Absenteeism_Analysis/blob/main/Deploying%20model%20on%20new%20data/Absenteeism%20-%20Integration.ipynb>Deployment of the absenteeism module</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/katrac/Absenteeism_Analysis/blob/main/Absenteeism.twbx>Tableau file</a></li></ul></div></div><div id=post-footer class="post-footer main-content-wrap"><div class=post-footer-tags><span class="text-color-light text-small">TAGGED IN</span><br><a class="tag tag--primary tag--small" href=https://katrac.github.io/katrac/tags/python/>Python</a>
